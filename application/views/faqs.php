<h3>Who can sell? How do I become a seller?</h3>

College Canvas strives to promote creativity on college campuses and help students earn extra income while pursing a creative passion. Therefore, we only allow university and college students to sell on the site. In order to sell you must have an active .edu email address for a university currently on College Canvas. Simply go to Request an Invite to Sell and you will receive an email to your .edu email account with a link to activate your “Canvas Shop.” We reserve the right to deactivate any account according to the terms outlined in our Terms and Conditions agreement. 

<h3>Why is my school not listed?</h3>

College Canvas moves to a new campus one campus at a time, and until your school has been added to the site, we are sorry to say, you will be unable to sell. College Canvas moves to new schools every month, so still request an invite to sell! We will have your .edu email address stored in our system to notify you when your university has been added! Plus, if we see that a lot of students from your university want to sell, we will try to move to your campus quickly!

<h3>What items can be sold on a “Canvas Shop”?</h3>

All items on College Canvas must be either handmade by you, the seller, or vintage.  “Handmade” includes fine arts, sculptures, crafts, clothing, knits, and more! Check out our “Categories” for ideas of what is acceptable to sell. Vintage items should be at 20 years or older.  Items that do not follow the guidelines will be removed immediately from the site. 
Are there fees to sell?

No! That’s, right, College Canvas is free for students and always will be! We are here to help you achieve the education you have always dreamed of. So there are no listing fees and no commissions, and there will always be a free option for students to sell their items on College Canvas. However, depending on how you choose to collect payment, some outside services may charge fees for payment. Read Payment Options and Policies  more details. 

<h3>What happens when a seller graduates?</h3>

Unfortunately we all have to leave college eventually, but College Canvas wants to help you during that transition! After your account has been active for five years, we will email your .edu account to verify if you are still a student (some do choose the 6 year plan!) or not. If you have graduated we will move your account so that other students will have the opportunity to sell and get their items seen. Regardless of if you begin your selling account your 1st year in college or your 4th, you will have 5 years of selling! We want to help those recent graduates pay off their student loans too! 

<h3>What is the privacy policy of College Canvas? </h3>

College Canvas believes privacy is an important part in building our online community, and we therefore will not sell your information for any purposes unless explicit permission is provided. See our Terms and Conditions  for more information. 

<h3>What is a “Canvas Group”? How do I form a “Canvas Group”?</h3>

Canvas Groups are a way for groups on campus to have all their items on one “Canvas Shop”. You will create an individual account and then form a group by going to the Group page. A group must have at least 3 other members from the same university, in addition to the administrator who formed the group. 
<br><br>
Groups are designed to make selling for fundraisers for a campus group easy! You list your items individually to that shop once you have been accepted into the group from the administrator. The administrator(s) is/are responsible for filling and shipping all items sold. They will be notified to their email account when an order from the group has been placed. The “Canvas Group” will also have its own payment policy. You can have your own Canvas Shop while also being a part of a “Canvas Group”, but if you are selling an item on behalf of a group, you may not also list that item in your personal shop. The two inventories should remain separate. 

<h3>How is payment processed? </h3>

The individual buyers choose how they will accept paymnt. They may choose to accept payment through personal checks or money orders received by mail. Once they rceive the payment they will ship the item. Users may also use Paypal to make payment fast, easy and safe! To learn more about the Paypal go to www.paypal.com. 
I did not receive my item… how do I obtain a refund?
<br><br>
College Canvas is a venue. We do not hold inventory and do not process payments, and can therefore not direcetly give you a refund. We encourage you to contact the seller directly at the email address they provided when you made your purchase. In addition, please contact us at disputes@collegecanvas.org 
<br><br>
If a seller has a history of disputes their profile will be deactivated. If the seller fails to provide a refund, contact Paypal, your Credit Card company or bank to cancel the payment or to get a refund. 

<h3>How do I report an item?</h3>

If you find an item or seller who you belive is selling items that are not in accordance with our polices, are not handmade or vintage, or infringe upon copyright laws and protection, please report the item immediately to reports@collegecanvas.org

All items should be shipped and filled within 7 business days of an order. Hold our sellers accountable by giving them reviews after they placed their order.
