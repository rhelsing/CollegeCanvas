“Creativity is a natural extension to our enthusiasm.”<br><br>

The mission of collegecanvas.org is to encourage creativity, education, and entrepreneurship among college students by providing an online market for the sale of handmade goods and other creative pursuits.  We strive to support students in pursuing a creative passion and aid them in alleviating part of the financial pressures of higher education. 
</div>
If you believe in the importance of education, the beauty of originality, and the freedom of creativity, then begin browsing the handmade and vintage items sold by students. 
<br><br>
We are free for students! No fees, no commissions. So every dollar of your purchase will directly benefit the student.
<br><br>
The idea for College Canvas began on the University of Georgia campus the fall of 2012 and was officially launched in January 2013. The site was made by students for students. 
<br><br>
Students can sell. Anyone can buy.
